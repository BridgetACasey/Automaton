Graded Unit project for HND Computer Games Development at Dundee and Angus College.
Created in Unity 2018.3.7. Project began in December 2018 and was submitted May 2019.
Awarded grade was 'A' by SQA standards.
Contains some incomplete code for unimplemented features, such as a planned save system that is absent from the final build.
Contains some additional visual and gameplay bugs that I was unable to rectify before submission.
