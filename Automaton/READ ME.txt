This was my HND project and the first finished game I ever made at age 18/19.
It was also my first time making a game in Unity so I spent a while getting to grips
with the engine. It was a highly rewarding challenge and I would love to go
back and fix some bugs and improve the game overall if I ever find the time.

Notes on Game -
--------------
WASD/Arrow keys to move
SPACE to jump
TAB to open settings/help menu and see additional controls
Left Mouse Button to grapple

Find the total number of energy cubes needed per room to unlock
the door to the next puzzle
When you find an energy cube, put it on a pedestal by the blue
door
Some objects are locked behind orange doors
Orange doors need bombs to open them
Remember, you can only carry one object at a time
Collect notepads to unlock extra lore

If you complete the game, just ALT + F4
